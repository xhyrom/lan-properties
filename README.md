**LAN Properties** enhances the vanilla "Open to LAN" interface to provide full control over all server settings, just like in server.properties on a dedicated server.

## What is LAN Properties?

LAN Properties is a mod that gives you access to all server.properties settings when opening your world to LAN, just like on a dedicated server.

## How do I use it?

Simply install the mod and click "Open to LAN" as normal. There will be a configuration button that lets you customize all server settings.
